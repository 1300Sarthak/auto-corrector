# auto-corrector

made it for my rulebasedAI project

#planning for the application:
UI :  
 libraries: tkinker
theme: https://github.com/rdbende/Sun-Valley-ttk-theme

    Basic use case:
        a user will input their text, and then it will check if those words in the .csv file or not
        if a file is not in the .csv file it will check it as 'incorrect' and return all the words that are spelled wrongly at the bottom!

#Steps:

    1. combine all of the .csv files in Dbeaver using SQL

    2. figure out how to do the UI and make different pages for it

    3. test it out and have it return all the mispelled words

    4. try to do off by 1 character (DSA basic thing I did this before on leetcode)

    5.

I got the words csv files from: https://www.bragitoff.com/2016/03/english-dictionary-in-csv-format/
